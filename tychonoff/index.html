over uniformly continuous decidable predicates on infinite collections
of types</h1>
<p>Todd Waugh Ambridge, 15th December 2021 and 1st February 2022</p>
<p>I explore, in the following two blog posts, two key concepts:
searchable types and closeness functions.</p>

<li><a href="InfiniteSearch1.html">Please click here to read Part
I.</a></li>
<li><a href="InfiniteSearch2.html">Please click here to read Part
II.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The blog posts are written in literate Agda, meaning that everything
is both explained in text and fully-foramlised in Agda. I use Martín
Escardó’s Agda library <a
href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/agda-new/">TypeTopology</a> as a
framework.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<pre class="Agda"><a id="643" class="Keyword">module</a> <a id="650" href="InfiniteSearch.html" class="Module">InfiniteSearch</a> <a id="665" class="Keyword">where</a>

<p>A type X is searchable if, given any predicate <code>p : X →
{tt,ff}</code>, we can find some <code>x : X</code> such that if there
is some x₀ such that <code>p(x₀) ≡ tt</code> then also <code>p(x) ≡
tt</code>.</p>
<p>In <a
href="http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/">Haskell</a>,
or <a
href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/agda/CountableTychonoff.html">Agda
with the termination checker turned off</a>, we can write a program that
searches Cantor space (infinitary binary sequences) ─ in fact, Martín
Escardó wrote both programs, in <a
href="http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/">2007</a>
and <a
href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/agda/CountableTychonoff.html">2011</a>
respectively.</p>
<p>The latter program goes further than just the Cantor space, it in
fact shows that searchable types are closed under countable
(<code>ℕ</code>-indexed) products. Given that searchable types coincide
with the topological notion of compact types, this program – along with
the proof that it terminates – are tantamount to the Tychonoff theorem
for searchable types.</p>
<p>The proofs that these programs terminate rely on classical logic;
they assume that the given predicates are continuous, and they use
classical logic to determine that they are uniformly continuous. We wish
to give a constructive formulation of the the Tychonoff theorem for
searchable types by explicitly restricting to uniformly continuous
predicates.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a predicate <code>p : X → {tt,ff}</code> is uniformly
continuous if there is some notion of precision <code>δ</code> such
that, for all <code>x,y : X</code> that are <code>δ</code>-close if
<code>p(x) ≡ tt</code> then also <code>p(y) ≡ tt</code>.</p>
<p>We find it convenient to formulate uniform continuity using the
notion of a closeness function. If a type <code>X</code> has a closeness
function <code>c : X × X → ℕ∞</code>, where <code>ℕ∞</code> is the
natural numbers extended with a point at infinity, then we can define a
version of uniform continuity on predicates of that type. Using this
version of uniform continuity, the notion of precision is a natural
number <code>δ : ℕ</code>, and two elements <code>x,y : X</code> are
<code>δ</code>-close if <code>δ ≼ c(x,y)</code>.</p>
<p>If a type has a canonical closeness function such that we can search
the type for the answer to any predicate that is uniformly continuous
with respect to the closeness function, then it is called (uniformly)
continuously searchable.</p>
<p>We prove the Tychonoff theorem for continuously searchable types in
constructive mathematics.</p>

<p>In the first part, we introduce the type theory and the concepts of
closeness functions and continuously searchable types formally.</p>
<p>Then, we show that: 1. Every discrete type has a canonical closeness
function, and that every such type is continuously searchable with
respect to this closeness function if it is searchable in the
traditional sense. 1. Every sequence type of discrete types has a
canonical closness function, and that every such type is continuously
searchable with respect to this closeness function.</p>

<p>In the second part, we show that types equipped with closeness
functions are closed under countable products. Further, and chiefly,
continuously searchable types themselves are closed under countable
products.</p>
